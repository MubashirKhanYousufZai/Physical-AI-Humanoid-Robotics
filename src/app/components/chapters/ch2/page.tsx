              Once the foundational disciplines of AI and Robotics are understood, this chapter explores why and how these fields converge. 
              Humanoids require AI because their high dimensionality — multiple joints, sensors, and actuators — makes manual programming infeasible. 
              AI enables autonomous adaptation in complex, unstructured environments, helping robots interact naturally with humans and make context-aware decisions.

              A central concept in humanoid design is <strong className="text-purple-600">Cognitive Architecture</strong>, which allows robots to sense, plan, and act. 
              We explore the classic Sense-Plan-Act paradigm, comparing <strong className="text-indigo-600">Deliberative architectures</strong> (which compute carefully before acting) with <strong className="text-purple-600">Reactive architectures</strong> (which respond quickly based on current stimuli). 
              Modern implementations often use <strong className="text-indigo-600">Behavior Trees</strong> to organize complex behaviors in an intuitive and scalable manner.

              Simulation plays a critical role in AI-driven humanoid development. Students are introduced to the <strong className="text-purple-600">Sim2Real</strong> problem, highlighting the gap between virtual training and real-world deployment. 
              Virtual environments such as MuJoCo, Gazebo, and Webots allow safe experimentation and development of control policies, but transferring learned behaviors to physical robots requires careful calibration and adaptation.

              Data-driven approaches, including reinforcement learning and supervised learning, are emphasized to train humanoid behaviors. 
              AI algorithms allow robots to navigate, manipulate objects, and recognize human gestures or commands. 
              Emphasis is placed on balancing computational efficiency with physical feasibility, ensuring robots act safely and reliably in dynamic environments.

              Finally, we discuss the fusion of perception, cognition, and action. 
              Effective integration allows humanoids to anticipate human intentions, plan multi-step actions, and execute tasks with precision. 
              By the end of this chapter, students understand the high-level computational structures and AI techniques necessary to build functional humanoids capable of operating autonomously and safely in the real world.
