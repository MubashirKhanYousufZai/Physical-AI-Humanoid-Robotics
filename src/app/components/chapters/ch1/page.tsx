              This chapter establishes the core terminology and historical context for both Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 
              In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we differentiate between <strong className="text-indigo-600">Strong AI</strong> (human-level cognition capable of reasoning, learning, and decision-making across domains) and <strong className="text-purple-600">Weak AI</strong> (specialized systems performing a single task like virtual assistants or recommendation engines). 
              Understanding these distinctions is crucial, as it shapes the expectations, applications, and limitations of modern AI technologies.

          {/* Paragraph 2 */}
          <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg transform transition-all hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-2xl animate-fadeIn delay-200">
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 text-justify">
              We also examine the spectrum from <strong className="text-indigo-600">Narrow AI</strong>, which excels in one domain, to the elusive <strong className="text-purple-600">General AI (AGI)</strong>, which aspires to perform any intellectual task a human can. 
              Furthermore, the historical debate between <strong className="text-indigo-600">Symbolic AI</strong> (rule-based, logic-driven) and <strong className="text-purple-600">Connectionist AI</strong> (neural networks that learn patterns from data) provides insight into the evolution of machine intelligence. 
              These foundational concepts allow students to critically evaluate modern AI systems.

          {/* Paragraph 3 */}

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 text-justify">
              Concurrently, Robotics is introduced as the study of machines that can interact with the physical world. 
              Mechanics, control theory, and kinematics form the backbone of this discipline. Students explore <strong className="text-purple-600">Forward and Inverse Kinematics</strong> to understand how joints and limbs move, while <strong className="text-indigo-600">Dynamics</strong> analyzes forces and torques acting on a system. 
              Actuators, sensors, and controllers are examined in detail, highlighting the importance of hardware-software integration in autonomous systems.

          <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg transform transition-all hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-2xl animate-fadeIn delay-600">
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 text-justify">
              Control systems are further classified into <strong className="text-purple-600">Open-loop</strong> (predefined commands) and <strong className="text-indigo-600">Closed-loop</strong> (feedback-based) architectures. 
              Closed-loop systems, for instance, allow robots to adapt their actions in real-time, ensuring stability and accuracy. 
              This knowledge is critical when designing humanoid robots that must balance, walk, and manipulate objects precisely while responding to dynamic environments.

          {/* Paragraph 5 */}
          <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg transform transition-all hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-2xl animate-fadeIn delay-800">
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 text-justify">
              Finally, we explore the <strong className="text-indigo-600">Humanoid Form Factor</strong>. 
              Designing robots to resemble humans involves considerations of <strong className="text-purple-600">Anthropomorphism</strong>, <strong className="text-indigo-600">Degrees of Freedom (DoF)</strong>, and balance. 
              Landmark robots such as ASIMO and Atlas demonstrate solutions to bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and sensory integration. 
              Understanding these mechanical and cognitive principles sets the stage for integrating AI into physically capable, human-like machines, forming the foundation for the chapters ahead.
