            About AI & Humanoid Robotics
          </h1>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Humanoid Robotics are two closely intertwined fields that aim to create machines capable of performing tasks with human-like intelligence and physical ability. 
            AI provides the cognitive foundation for humanoids, enabling them to perceive their environment, make decisions, learn from experience, and interact naturally with humans.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Core AI techniques such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and path planning allow robots to understand their surroundings, recognize objects and human emotions, and plan complex movements.
            Humanoid robotics, on the other hand, focuses on the mechanical and control aspects, including bipedal locomotion, joint coordination, sensor integration, and dexterous manipulation.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">
            By combining AI with advanced robotic design, humanoids can navigate unstructured environments, perform social interactions safely, and execute physical tasks with precision. Together, these fields are driving the development of intelligent, autonomous machines that can assist, collaborate with, and enhance human life in diverse domains.
