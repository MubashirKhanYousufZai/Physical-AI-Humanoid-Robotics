# 🧠 Foundations of Physical AI

**Physical AI** is the crucial discipline where **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is applied directly to **embodied robotic systems** that dynamically perceive, interact with, and manipulate the physical world.

## 🔑 Key Concepts in Physical AI

### **Embodied Intelligence**

This principle posits that intelligence is inherently tied to a physical body situated within an environment. Robots must **perceive, plan, and execute actions** while being constrained by real-world physics and their own mechanical structure.

### **Sensors**

These are the robot's **input devices**, essential for gathering data from the external world. They include visual sensors (cameras), ranging sensors (LiDAR), and tactile/proprioceptive sensors (touch and joint encoders) to measure position, distance, and force.

### **Actuators**

The **output mechanisms** responsible for physical movement and manipulation. These are typically motors, gears, and joints that translate digital control signals from the AI into mechanical force and motion, enabling the robot to perform physical tasks. 

### **Perception**

The ability of the AI system to process raw sensor data and construct a **meaningful, three-dimensional understanding** of its surroundings. This crucial step involves object recognition, depth estimation, and state tracking of the environment.

### **Decision Making**

The core AI function where algorithms (such as Reinforcement Learning, classic planning, or state machines) analyze the perceptual data and current goals to **determine the optimal next action** or sequence of movements for the actuators.

Physical AI ultimately enables robots to perform **complex tasks** that demand high levels of **interaction, adaptation, and continuous learning** from their dynamic environment.
